CSR and SSR exist because different problems need different trade-offs


WHY CLIENT-SIDE RENDERING (CSR)?
I want fast interactions without reloading the page.
Page updates without refresh
Smooth UI interactions
Less server load after first load
Rich frontend experience

Examples
Dashboards
Admin panels
Chat apps
Gmail-like apps

Server sends files once
Browser does the heavy work
UI updates using JS only


Problems
Blank screen until JS loads
Slower first page load
Poor SEO (search engines see empty HTML)
JS failure = broken UI







WHY SERVER-SIDE RENDERING (SSR)?
I want content visible immediately and searchable


Fast first paint
Works without JS
SEO friendly
Better for slow devices

Examples

Blogs
News websites
E-commerce product pages
Landing pages


Problems
More server load
Full page reloads
Less smooth interactions
Harder to scale for huge traffic
